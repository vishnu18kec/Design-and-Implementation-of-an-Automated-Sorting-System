# Design-and-Implementation-of-an-Automated-Sorting-System
# 🎯 Automated Sorting System using Mechatronics Principles

This project was developed for the **Intel Unnati** initiative. It showcases a smart sorting system using a Raspberry Pi, camera, and conveyor mechanism. The system detects balls based on their **color** and **automatically sorts** them using a mechatronic control setup.

## 💡 Features

- Real-time color detection using OpenCV
- HSV tuning for accurate recognition of Pink, Orange, and Yellow balls
- On-screen display of ball counts per color
- Servo motor-based diverter system that sorts the balls into different boxes based on their color
- Designed and implemented using **mechatronics principles**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Raspberry Pi
- Python & OpenCV
- USB Camera
- - Servo Motor for physical sorting based on detection result
- Basic mechanical conveyor system for ball movement
