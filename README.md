# Design-and-Implementation-of-an-Automated-Sorting-System
# 🎯 Automated Sorting System using Mechatronics Principles

This project was developed for the **Intel Unnati** initiative. It showcases a smart sorting system using a Raspberry Pi, camera, and conveyor mechanism. The system detects balls based on their **color** and **automatically sorts** them using a mechatronic control setup.
